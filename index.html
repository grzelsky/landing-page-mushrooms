        <h2>about mushrooms</h2>
        <p>
          A characteristic that places fungi in a different kingdom from plants,
          bacteria, and some protists is chitin in their cell walls. Similar to
          animals, fungi are heterotrophs; they acquire their food by absorbing
          dissolved molecules, typically by secreting digestive enzymes into
          their environment. Fungi do not photosynthesize. Growth is their means
          of mobility, except for spores (a few of which are flagellated), which
          may travel through the air or water. Fungi are the principal
          decomposers in ecological systems. These and other differences place
          fungi in a single group of related organisms, named the Eumycota (true
          fungi or Eumycetes), which share a common ancestor (from a
          monophyletic group), an interpretation that is also strongly supported
          by molecular phylogenetics. This fungal group is distinct from the
          structurally similar myxomycetes (slime molds) and oomycetes (water
          molds). The discipline of biology devoted to the study of fungi is
          known as mycology (from the Greek μύκης mykes, mushroom). In the past,
          mycology was regarded as a branch of botany, although it is now known
          fungi are genetically more closely related to animals than to plants.

            Amanita muscaria, commonly known as the fly agaric or fly amanita,
            is a basidiomycete of the genus Amanita. It is also a muscimol
            mushroom. Native throughout the temperate and boreal regions of the
            Northern Hemisphere, Amanita muscaria has been unintentionally
            introduced to many countries in the Southern Hemisphere, generally
            as a symbiont with pine and birch plantations, and is now a true
            cosmopolitan species. It associates with various deciduous and
            coniferous trees.

            Mycena galericulata is a mushroom species commonly known as the
            common bonnet, the toque mycena, or the rosy-gill fairy helmet. The
            type species of the genus Mycena was first described scientifically
            in 1772, but was not considered a Mycena until 1821. It is quite
            variable in color, size, and shape, which makes it somewhat
            difficult to reliably identify in the field. The mushrooms have caps
            with distinct radial grooves, particularly at the margin. The cap's
            color varies from grayish brown to dark brown and the shape ranges
            from bell-like to bluntly conical to flattened with an umbo. The
            stem is hollow, white, tough and thin, without a ring and often
            roots deeply into the wood on which it grows.

            Mycena epipterygia is a common species in Western Europe (amongst
            others Netherlands and Belgium). It grows in diverse habitats: in
            deciduous and coniferous woods, but it is also found in heather and
            agrid grasslands. This species grows on the ground. Mycena
            epipterygia has a sticky, elastic and deductible surface. Its cap is
            one to two centimetres wide and its colour varies over yellowish
            brown to gray-brown. The stipe is yellowish to yellow-green.

            Strobilurus tenacellus, commonly known as the pinecone cap, is a
            species of agaric fungus in the family Physalacriaceae. It is found
            in Asia and Europe, where it grows on the fallen cones of pine and
            spruce trees. The fruit bodies (mushrooms) are small, with convex to
            flat, reddish to brownish caps up to 15 mm in diameter, set atop
            thin cylindrical stems up to 4–7.5 cm long with a rooting base. A
            characteristic microscopic feature of the mushroom is the sharp,
            thin-walled cystidia found on the stipe, gills, and cap. The
            mushrooms, sometimes described as edible, are too small to be of
            culinary interest.

            Xeromphalina campanella is a species of mushroom. The common names
            of the species include the golden trumpet and the bell Omphalina.
            The genus name Xeromphalina means "little dry navel" and campanella
            means "bell-shaped", respectively describing the mature and young
            shapes of the pileus, or cap.The mushroom is also called fuzzy-foot.

            Mycena galopus is found in North America and Europe. The saprobic
            fungus is an important leaf litter decomposer, and able to utilize
            all the major constituents of plant litter. It is especially adept
            at attacking cellulose and lignin, the latter of which is the second
            most abundant renewable organic compound in the biosphere. The
            mushroom latex contains chemicals called benzoxepines, which are
            thought to play a role in a wound-activated chemical defense
            mechanism against yeasts and parasitic fungi.

        <h2>about us</h2>
        <p>
          We love mushrooms in every form. We like the colorful ones the most,
          they are very easy to spot in the litter, they look very tasty,
          especially the red ones with white dots. We are gourmets of mushrooms
          that nobody picks up. All you need to do is to boil them longer and
          pour out the water a few more times.
